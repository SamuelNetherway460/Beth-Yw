Development Details

bethyw was developed with on Mac OS Catalina using IDEs CLion and VSCode. The application was compiled and tested using Apple clang version 11.0.0 (clang-1100.0.33.17).

Submission

The submitted source files compiled without warning and passed all tests locally. Additionally, all Autograder tests passed without warning or errors.

Development Issues

Whilst using CLion, absolute file paths had to be used in order to find and open files. Despite this, the submitted source files do not make use of absolute file paths i.e., only specify the desired file starting from the /datasets directory.
